# 21T2 SecSoc x CSESoc Newbie CTF

Repository for challenges in the 2021 SecSoc x CSESoc Newbie CTF, with writeups for most challenges, and source code included so that you can run it for yourself.

Want to submit your own community writeup for a challenge (even one which already has a writeup)? Make a pull request! We love to see different approaches to solving problems.

We hope you had fun participating in the CTF! Stay tuned for updates on future CTFs and events and come hang out with us on discord!! :)
