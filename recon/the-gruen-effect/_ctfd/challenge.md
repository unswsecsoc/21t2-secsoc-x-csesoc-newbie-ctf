Ever heard of the 'Guren Effect'? Ikea does it so well, that just by looking at it, I've lost sense of where I am!

**Note:** Flag format is NEWBIE{Location}, so Ikea Rhodes will be NEWBIE{Rhodes} and Ikea Jebel Ali will be NEWBIE{Jebel_Ali} (Case Insensitive)

**Note 2:** We'll be monitoring submission logs, so please don't attempt to brute force this challenge, and have an actual go :)
