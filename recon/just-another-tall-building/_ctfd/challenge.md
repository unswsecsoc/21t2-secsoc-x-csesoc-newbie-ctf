No two tall buildings look the same... change my mind.

**Note:** Flag format is NEWBIE{City}, so Sydney will be NEWBIE{Sydney} and Rio de Janeiro will be NEWBIE{Rio_de_Janeiro} (Case Insensitive)

**Note 2:** We'll be monitoring submission logs, so please don't attempt to brute force this challenge, and have an actual go :)
