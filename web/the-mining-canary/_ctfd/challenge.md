Ever heard of the mining canary? They were once used in mines to help detect colourless and toxic gas. Nowadays in security, they are sneaky baits for early detection, alerting defenders someone is snooping around places they shouldn't be in. You should try snooping around this site, maybe there is something interesting in the code.
