            What more do you need to know, I'm a cool guy. I make epic website and design immaculate stylesheets. If you want to be like me you can just give up now.
            Unlike most humans, I have no faults and frankly it would probably be impossible for me to even get one as I'm fairly sure I am genetically immune to error.
            Anyhow, while you are here I guess you can just take look at my self-portrait and gaze at my epicness, peace out XD.
