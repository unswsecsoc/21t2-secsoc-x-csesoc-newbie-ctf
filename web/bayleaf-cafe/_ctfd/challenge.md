Hi! I'm the CEO of Bayleaf Cafe Incorporated, the finest cafe in all of the west! I recently learned how to code a website because I was bored, and I already think I'm an expert!

I learnt about this cool thing called JSON Web Tokens as a way of authenticating a user and storing data about their authorisation. I've implemented it on the new payroll system I made for my cafe. Since I'm so good, I didn't read the documentation and figured out how to use it myself.

It's a work in progress, but employees each get their own account to access their timesheets. I've created a sample account with username 'employee1' and password 'i-work-at-the-most-secure-cafe-ever'.

Since I'm a fantastic coder, I know that my website is unhackable, and no one can access things that they aren't meant to!
