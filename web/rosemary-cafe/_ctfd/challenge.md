Hello! I'm the CEO of Rosemary Cafe. I heard that the Bayleaf Cafe was having some issues with their login system. Thankfully, my website only has a single admin account, so it should be safer than theirs!

Also, the Bayleaf Cafe doesn't even serve hash browns - what kind of cafe doesn't serve hash browns???? Our cafe serves hash browns (don't tell anyone, but they're frozen from Woolies). We don't add any extra salt to our hash browns either!
