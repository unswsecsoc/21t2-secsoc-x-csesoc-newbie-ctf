hello! i'm the owner of oregano cafe! Unlike other cafes, we serve our very own homemade hash browns.

i heard our friends and competitors over at rosemary had issues using store-bought hash browns, so we hired a robot to copy their website (dont tell them this), but use a unique hash brown recipe.

surely our website is secure if no-one can google for our top-secret hash brown recipe? i made sure it was impossible to google!
